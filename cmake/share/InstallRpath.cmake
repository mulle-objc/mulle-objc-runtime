# MULLE_NO_CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH can be used to kill this codepath
# This is not used during a regular craft, but only when "install" is run.
# One could enable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH for build by setting
# set( CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH ON)
# but this is usually counterproductive, since lib will be really in
# ../../dependency/lib
#
# CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH must be defined before add_executable or add_library
