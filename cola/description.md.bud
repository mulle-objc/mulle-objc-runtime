A portable Objective-C runtime written in C11. No Assembler required.
It follows the Apple "Objective-C 1 Runtime" and [adds many features](//www.mulle-kybernetik.com/weblog/2015/mulle_objc_present_and_absent.html)
from "Objective-C 2.0", but the runtime function calls are completely different.
It is designed to be suitable for massive multi-threading.
