=== Comprehensive mulle_objc_class_methodlist_walk Test ===

1. Testing DerivedClass METACLASS (class methods):
Expected order: DerivedCategory -> Derived -> BaseCategory -> Base -> Protocols -> NSObject -> NSObject infraclass (wraparound)
1. DerivedClass (DerivedCategory):
   + derivedCategoryClassMethod
2. DerivedClass (class):
   + derivedClassMethod
3. ThirdProtocol (protocol class):
   + thirdProtocolClassMethod
4. SecondProtocol (protocol class):
   + secondProtocolClassMethod
5. BaseClass (SecondBaseCategory):
   + secondBaseCategoryClassMethod
6. BaseClass (BaseCategory):
   + baseCategoryClassMethod
7. BaseClass (class):
   + protocolClassMethod
   + baseClassMethod
8. BaseClass (SecondBaseCategory):
   - secondBaseCategoryInstanceMethod
9. BaseClass (BaseCategory):
   - baseCategoryInstanceMethod
10. BaseClass (class):
   - baseInstanceMethod
   - protocolInstanceMethod
Total metaclass methodlists: 10
Checking wraparound: Should include NSObject infraclass methods at end

2. Testing DerivedClass INFRACLASS (instance methods):
Expected order: DerivedCategory -> Derived -> BaseCategory -> Base -> Protocols -> NSObject
1. DerivedClass (DerivedCategory):
   - derivedCategoryInstanceMethod
2. DerivedClass (class):
   - derivedInstanceMethod
3. ThirdProtocol (protocol class):
   - thirdProtocolInstanceMethod
4. SecondProtocol (protocol class):
   - secondProtocolInstanceMethod
5. BaseClass (SecondBaseCategory):
   - secondBaseCategoryInstanceMethod
6. BaseClass (BaseCategory):
   - baseCategoryInstanceMethod
7. BaseClass (class):
   - baseInstanceMethod
   - protocolInstanceMethod
Total infraclass methodlists: 7

3. Testing inheritance chain completeness:
Metaclass should include full inheritance + wraparound to root infraclass
Infraclass should include full inheritance: categories -> class -> protocols -> super
PASS: Metaclass wraparound verified if NSObject infraclass methods found above
